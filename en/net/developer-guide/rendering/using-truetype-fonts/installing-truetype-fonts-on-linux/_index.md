## Purpose Summary

This page explains how to install TrueType fonts on Linux for correct rendering.

{{% /alert %}}

Most often, you will use Aspose.Words to convert DOC or DOCX documents to PDF format. If you need to do this on a Linux machine, this topic will help you to learn how to ensure Aspose.Words is rendering your documents with the best accuracy.

Most frequently, the DOC and DOCX documents, which need to be converted were created using Microsoft Word, on a Windows or Mac OS operating system. Therefore, most fonts used in DOC and DOCX documents are "Windows fonts" or "Office fonts",that are the fonts installed with Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Office. These fonts include Arial, Calibri, Cambria, Century Gothic, Courier New, Garamond, Tahoma, Verdana, Wingdings, and many others.

The problem is that the `TrueType` fonts listed above are not installed by default on Linux distributions. If you take a typical DOCX document that is formatted with the Cambria font and try to convert it to PDF format on Linux, Aspose.Words will use a different font because Cambria is not available. As a result, the PDF document will look different, in comparison to the original DOCX document. To make sure that documents converted by Aspose.Words appear as close as possible to the original, you need to install "Windows fonts" on your Linux system.

There are two main ways to get TrueType fonts on a Linux system:

- Copy .TTF and .TTC files from a Windows machine onto your Linux machine
- Install a `TrueType` font package, such as *msttcorefonts*

## Copying Fonts from a Windows Machine

An easy and quick way to get TrueType fonts on a Linux system is to copy .TTF and .TTC files from the `C:\Windows\Fonts` directory on a Windows machine to some directory on your Linux machine. You do not need to install or register these fonts on Linux in any way; you just need to specify the location of the fonts using the [FontSettings](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.fonts/fontsettings/) class in Aspose.Words.

Verify whether font licensing is required, and read the EULA carefully before installing MS Fonts on any Linux operating system.

## Install a `TrueType` Fonts Package

There are a number of Linux packages, containing Microsoft TrueType fonts, that you can download and install onto your Linux machine. The exact steps may be different on various Linux distributions.

- On Ubuntu, use Synaptic Package Manager to find and install the *ttf-mscorefonts-installer* package.
- On openSUSE, use Yast2→ Software Management to find and install the *fetchmsttfonts* package.
- UseLiberation Fontslicensed under OFL, as an alternative to standard Windows fonts: Arial, Times New Roman, and Courier New.
- For font packages suitable to other Linux distributions, search availabledocumentation on the internet.

After installing the package, Aspose.Words will find these fonts in the folderson your system and use them when working with documents.

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How do I tell Aspose.Words where the copied TrueType fonts are located?  
   **A:** Create a `FontSettings` object, add the folder that contains the `.ttf`/`.ttc` files to `FontSettings.FontFolders`, and assign it to the document's `FontSettings` property.
   
2. **Q:** Do I need to register the fonts with the Linux operating system after copying them?  
   **A:** No. Aspose.Words can use fonts directly from the folder you specify via `FontSettings`. Registering the fonts with the OS is optional and only needed if other applications must use them.

3. **Q:** Will installing the `msttcorefonts` package automatically make the fonts available to Aspose.Words?  
   **A:** Yes. The package places the fonts in standard system directories (e.g., `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts`). Aspose.Words scans these locations automatically, so no additional code is required.

4. **Q:** Is a separate license required to use Microsoft fonts with Aspose.Words on Linux?  
   **A:** Aspose.Words licensing does not cover font licensing. You must comply with the font's EULA and any distribution rights. Verify that you have the appropriate rights to copy and use the fonts on your Linux server.
