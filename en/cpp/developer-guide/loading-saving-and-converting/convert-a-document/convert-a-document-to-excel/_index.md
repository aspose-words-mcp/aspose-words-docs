## Purpose Summary

This page outlines how to convert a Word document to Excel format (XLS/XLSX) using Aspose.Words.

{{% /alert %}}

Converting documents from one format to another is the flagship feature of Aspose.Words. You can convert documents in any available [load format](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words/loadformat/) also to XLSX format.

## Convert a Document to XLSX

Converting a document to XLSX is a rather complicated process. To save your document to XLSX format using Aspose.Words, use the [XlsxSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.saving/xlsxsaveoptions/) class and the new `Xlsx` element in the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words/saveformat/) enumeration. As mentioned above, you can save the document in any load format supported by Aspose.Words to XLSX.

The following code example shows how to save DOCX to XLSX:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "0833496410d6beb2913f35494196888e" "docx-to-xlsx.h" >}}

{{% alert color="primary" %}}

Sometimes it is necessary to specify additional options, which can affect the result of saving a document as a XLSX. These options can be specified using the [XlsxSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.saving/xlsxsaveoptions/) class, containing properties that determine how the XLSX output will be displayed.

## Find and Replace When Saving to XLSX

Also using Aspose.Words, you can find a specific string or regular expression in your document and replace it with the matching one you need. Then you can also save the result to XLSX format.

The following code example shows how to perform find and replace operation and save result to XLSX:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "b08318e6eb24ad14897dfce529b9b9fc" "find-replace-xlsx.h" >}}

## Specify Compression Level When Saving to XLSX

You can also specify the compression level when saving using the [CompressionLevel](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.saving/xlsxsaveoptions/get_compressionlevel/) property.

The following code example shows how to specify the compression level when saving to XLSX format:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "b08318e6eb24ad14897dfce529b9b9fc" "compress-xlsx.h" >}}

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How can I convert a DOCX document to Excel (XLSX) using Aspose.Words for C++?  
   **A:** Load the DOCX with the `Document` class and call `Save` specifying an XLSX file name. Aspose.Words automatically detects the source format and writes the spreadsheet. Example:  
   ```cpp
   auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(MyDir + u"Document.docx");
   doc->Save(ArtifactsDir + u"Result.xlsx");
   ```

2. **Q:** Can I perform find‑and‑replace on a document before saving it as Excel?  
   **A:** Yes. Use `FindReplaceOptions` together with `Range::Replace` to modify the document content, then save the updated document to XLSX. The same code shown in the “Find and Replace When Saving to XLSX” section applies.

3. **Q:** How do I control the compression level of the generated XLSX file?  
   **A:** Create an `XlsxSaveOptions` instance, set its `CompressionLevel` property (e.g., `CompressionLevel::Maximum`), and pass the options to `Document::Save`. This reduces file size at the cost of longer save time.

4. **Q:** Do I need a license to convert documents to Excel, and how do I apply it in C++?  
   **A:** A license is required for production use to remove evaluation watermarks and enable full functionality. Load the license file with the `License` class before any document operations:  
   ```cpp
   auto license = MakeObject<License>();
   license->SetLicense(u"Path/To/Aspose.Words.CPP.lic");
   ```
   After setting the license, all conversion features work without restrictions.
