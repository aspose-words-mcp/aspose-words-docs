This topic discusses how to implement Markdown features using Aspose.Words. Markdown is a simple way to format plain text that can easily be converted to HTML. Aspose.Words supportsthe following Markdown features:

- Headings
- Blockquotes
- Horizontal rules
- Bold emphasis
- Italic emphasis

The Markdown feature implementationmostly follows the `CommonMark` specification in Aspose.Words API and all the features are represented as corresponding styles or direct formatting. Which means that

- Bold and Italic are represented as [Font.bold](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/font/bold/) and [Font.Italic](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/font/italic/).
- Headings are paragraphs with Heading 1 - Heading 6 styles.
- Quotes are paragraphs with "Quote" in the style name.
- HorizontalRule is a paragraph with HorizontalRule shape.
