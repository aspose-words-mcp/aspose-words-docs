*Splitting*or*split a document*is the process of breaking a large document into a greater number of smaller files. There are various reasons to split a file. For example, you only need some pages from a specific document and not the entire one. Or for privacy reasons, you want to share only some parts of a document with others.With the splitting feature, you can get only the required parts of the document and do the necessary actions with them, for example, to mark up, save, or send.

Aspose.Words provides you with an efficient way to split one document into multiple documents by headings or sections. You can also split a document by pages or by page ranges. Both splitting options will be described in this article.

To split a documentinto smaller files using Aspose.Words, you need to follow these steps:

1. Load the document in any supported format.
1. Split thedocument.
1. Save the output documents.

After you split a document, you will be able to open all the output documents that will start with the required pages, text, etc.

## Split a Document Using Different Criteria {#split-a-document-using-different-criteria}

Aspose.Words allows you to split EPUB or HTML documents into chapters according to various criteria.In the process, the style and layout of the source document is preserved for the output documents.

You can specify criteria using the [DocumentSplitCriteria](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.saving/documentsplitcriteria/)enumeration. So you can divide a document into chapters using one of the following criteria or combine more than one criteria together:

- heading paragraph,
- section break,
- column break,
- page break.

When saving the output to HTML, Aspose.Words save each individual chapter as a separate HTML file. As a result, the document will be split into multiple HTML files. When saving the output to EPUB, Aspose.Words save the result in a single EPUB file regardless of the [DocumentSplitCriteria](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.saving/documentsplitcriteria/) value you used.So, using [DocumentSplitCriteria](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.saving/documentsplitcriteria/) for EPUB documents only affects the appearance of their content in reader applications: content will be divided into chapters and the document will no longer appear continuous.

{{% alert color="primary" %}}

You cannot split a document using the [documentSplitCriteria](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.saving/htmlsaveoptions/documentSplitCriteria/) property when saving to MHTML format.

{{% /alert %}}

In this section, we consider only some of the possible split criteria.

### Split a Document by Headings {#split-a-document-by-headings}

To split a document into chapters by headings, use the [HeadingParagraph](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.saving/documentsplitcriteria/) value of the [documentSplitCriteria](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.saving/htmlsaveoptions/documentSplitCriteria/) property.

If you need to split a document by a specific level of heading paragraphs, such as headings 1, 2, and 3, use also the [documentSplitHeadingLevel](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.saving/htmlsaveoptions/documentSplitHeadingLevel/) property. The output will be divided by paragraphs formatted with the specified heading level.

The following code example shows how to split a document into smaller parts by heading:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "e4b272992a7c8fafdd7ff42f8c2de379" "split-document-by-headings.js" >}}

Please note that for this criteria, Aspose.Words only supports saving to HTML format when splitting.

When saving to EPUB, the document is not split into several files, and there will be only one output file.

### Split a Document by Sections {#split-a-document-by-sections}

Aspose.Words also enables you to use section breaks to split documents and save them to HTML. For this purpose, use [SectionBreak](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.saving/documentsplitcriteria/) as the [documentSplitCriteria](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.saving/htmlsaveoptions/documentSplitCriteria/):

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "76d266d6b68098eb4e95e484fe85538e" "split-document-by-sections-html.js" >}}

There is another way to split the source document into multiple output documents, and you can choose any output format supported by Aspose.Words.

The following code example shows how to splita document into smaller parts by section breaks (without using the [documentSplitCriteria](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.saving/htmlsaveoptions/documentSplitCriteria/) property):

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "76d266d6b68098eb4e95e484fe85538e" "split-document-by-sections.js" >}}

## Splitting by Pages {#splitting-by-pages}

You can also split a document page by page, by page ranges, or starting with the specified page numbers. In such case the [extractPages](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/document/extractPages/) method can do the job.

This section describes several use cases of dividing documents by paged using the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/document/) class and the [extractPages](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/document/extractPages/) method.

{{% alert color="primary" %}}

You can use any [output format supported by Aspose.Words](/words/nodejs-net/supported-document-formats/).

Due to the many nuances appearing while reducing the number of pages, a full match with the Microsoft Word layout is quite a complicated task. Therefore, depending on the document complexity, there may be slight differences in the resulting document layout from the original document.

### Split a Document Page by Page {#split-a-document-page-by-page}

Aspose.Words enables you to split a multi-page document page by page.

The following code example shows how to divide a document and save each page as a separate document:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "76d266d6b68098eb4e95e484fe85538e" "split-document-page-by-page.js" >}}

### Split a Document by Page Ranges {#split-a-document-by-page-ranges}

Aspose.Words allows splitting a multi-page document by page ranges. You can split one file into multiple files with various page ranges or just select one range and save only this part of the source document. Note that you can choose the page range according to the maximum and minimum page number of a document.

The following code example shows how to split a document into smaller parts by page range with specific start and end indexes:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "76d266d6b68098eb4e95e484fe85538e" "split-document-by-page-range.js" >}}

## Merge the Split Document with Another File {#merge-the-split-document-with-another-file}

Aspose.Words enables you to merge theoutput splitdocument with anotherdocumentto form a newdocument.This can be called document merging.

The following code example shows how to merge a split document with another document:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "76d266d6b68098eb4e95e484fe85538e" "merge-split-documents.js" >}}

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How can I split a document by specific heading levels in Node.js?  
   **A:** Use the `documentSplitCriteria` set to `HeadingParagraph` and specify the desired level with `documentSplitHeadingLevel`. Load the document with `new asposewords.Document(...)`, set the criteria on `HtmlSaveOptions`, and call `save`. This splits the document at headings of the chosen level.

2. **Q:** What is the easiest way to split a document by page ranges?  
   **A:** Call the `extractPages(startPage, endPage)` method on the `Document` object. The method returns a new `Document` containing only the pages in the specified range, which you can then save in any supported format.

3. **Q:** Can the split parts be saved directly as PDF files?  
   **A:** Yes. After splitting (by headings, sections, pages, or ranges), simply use `PdfSaveOptions` or call `document.save("output.pdf")` on each resulting `Document` instance to produce PDF files.

4. **Q:** How do I merge several split documents back into a single file?  
   **A:** Load each split part as a `Document` and use the `appendDocument` method to concatenate them. After appending all parts, save the combined document in the desired format.

5. **Q:** Do I need a license to use the splitting and merging features?  
   **A:** The splitting and merging APIs are fully functional in the evaluation version, but the output will contain a watermark. To remove watermarks and unlock full capabilities, apply a valid Aspose.Words license using `License license = new License(); license.setLicense("Aspose.Words.lic");`.
